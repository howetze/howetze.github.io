## Welcome to my info page

My Name is Holger, I live in Tübingen and commute to Stuttgart for work. I studied economics and I'm still suffering from that :-)

However I ended up in a general IT enviroment, but without diving to deep into it.
At the moment I'm working for a big automotiv electronics company in the project management office (PMO) as a Configuration Manager.


### Live and work in a highly connected world

I really like these times we are living in, it is extremly exiting and I'm very curious about the future.


### Some sidelights about me:

- on a learning go journey (golang)
- computer stuff
- [fablab tübingen](https://www.fablab-neckar-alb.org/)
- LT28
- Allmountain 
- Tessier-Ashpool AI Research & Development

### Moreover I'm intrested in:

- continious integration
- embedded systems
- Docker
- all about the golang community
